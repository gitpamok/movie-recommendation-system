# movie-recommendation-system

There are basically two types of recommender systems implemented in the project:-

**1. Content Based Filtering** - They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.

**2. Collaborative Filtering** - This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.
